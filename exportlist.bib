abstract="In this chapter, by using the concept of quasi-linear function and approximation properties for the construction and error testing of the regression methods, , we establish a quasi-linear regression model (denoted by QLRM for short). Further we consider the parameter estimation strategy for QLRM and propose the parameter estimation, which is based on genetic algorithm and the method of least squares. We also do error testing based on the residual analysis and analyze the performance of the model by an illustrative example.",
